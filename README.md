- Tools & practices: Git/GitHub, Agile/Scrum, basic software design  
- Interests: Full-stack development, automation, and web applications  

### What I’m looking for
- Software engineering internships  
- Collaborative student or open-source projects  
- Remote or hybrid opportunities  

### How to reach me

### A little about me
Before transitioning into tech, I worked as a licensed cosmetologist, which strengthened my discipline, communication skills, and attention to detail. I bring that same mindset into software development while continuing to grow as an engineer.

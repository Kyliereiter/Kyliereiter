- Core concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, data structures, file I/O  
- Tools & practices: Git/GitHub, Agile/Scrum, basic software design  
- Interests: Full-stack development, automation, and web applications

### What I'm looking for
- Software engineering internships  
- Collaborative student or open-source projects  
- Remote or hybrid opportunities

### How to reach me
- Email: kylie_reiter@outlook.com  
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyliereiter93/

### A little about me
Before tech, I worked as a licensed cosmetologist, which taught me discipline, communication, and attention to detail. I bring that same mindset into software development while continuing to grow as an engineer.
